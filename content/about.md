I am a Python and Elixir backend software developer with a strong experience building resilient and distributed systems, passionate about discovering new and innovative solutions designed to improve experience with technology while helping business grow. 

I have experience using tools such as Postgres, Docker and Kubernetes. I am also interested in DevOps to optimize the company's multiple processes through automation. I'm enthusiastic about self-teaching myself about new concepts creating things.

While not working on my daily job, I may be hacking on [open source](https://github.com/joaothallis), [reading books](https://literal.club/joaothallis), [creating music](https://soundcloud.com/joaothallis), [writing](/posts/) about topics that interest me or playing some game (Magic: The Gathering Arena and Call of Duty: Warzone).

I am interested in programming languages, neovim, monitoring and audiovisual. Feel free to ping me somewhere if you want to chat about any of that. :cat2:
